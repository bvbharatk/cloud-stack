ABOUT:
        Log Collection Utility cloud-bugtool.

    The main purpose behind cloud-bugtool is to make easier collecting
    logs required for CloudStack/CloudPlatform troubleshooting
    and it mainly comes from Support. For those familiar with Xen/XenServer
    cloud-bugtool name may sound similar to xen-bugtool, this similarity
    is intentional.

    Current version of cloud-bugtool collects:
     - basic system and environment information
     - CP/CS management service logs
     - basic system logs
     - cloud database

        We DO NOT collect and do not want to collect any sensitive information.
    If there is still any sensitive pice of information please let us know
    and we will try to remove it or replace by meaningless data.

REQUIREMENTS:
        cloud-bugtool generally be can be run on any system where CloudPlatform
    (CloudStack) has been installed yet. Although it requires to be run with
    root privilages.

INSTALLATION:
        1. Copy onto CloudPlatform (CloudStack) system.
        2. chmod +x cloud-bugtool
        3. ./cloud-bugtool

HELP:
        In current version cloud-bugtool has few options which allow to specyfy
    which data will be collected. For more information please run cloud-bugtool
    with [-h|--help], it displays a usage message on standard output and exit.
    Just execute cloud-bugtool and it collects information from below list
    of CloudStack subsystems:
        - database (cloud database dump)
        - logs, content of /var/log/
        - basic system settings including networking
        - information from service vms (this is not implemented yet)
    All above is compressed, written to .zip file and the archive location
    is printed on user console.


TODO:
  - service VM subsystem implementation aka get the logs and other info
    from service VMs (router, proxy, storage VM)
  - better handling needs to be implemented for all subprocess calls
    add proper exception handling
  - operations on files and dirs, change to shutil module
  - this version works only with cloud 3.0.x and only when password
    is encrypted and saved in a file, other types of db pass storing
    not implemented
  - add the most popular imports to top of the file
       grep import * | awk '{print $5}' | sort
  - Manifest file: cloud-bugtool version, local execution date
  - detect subsystem results FAILED, OK

ABOUT:
	jef - Java Exception Finder
	   How often the only thing you need is to quickly find a Java
	exception in your logs? jef is a very simple bash script which
	let you quickly find all Java exceptions in your logs.
	Like I said jef is _very_ simple tools and not optimal but it does
	what it supposes to do for me, so hopefully for you too.

TODO:
	- make it smarter and more optimal
